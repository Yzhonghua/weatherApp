# WeatherApp

## Overview
This project can quickly obtain the weather conditions of a place and give some travel suggestions.

## Problem Statement
This app is very useful for everyone. You can check the weather conditions of your city in time, or check the weather conditions of the target city in advance, so as to make some travel preparations.

## Design and Implementation
WeatherApp uses GPS sensors and Fused Location Provider API to efficiently track precise user geolocation. It gets real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, sunrise and sunset times, weather conditions, maximum and minimum temperatures, and can give appropriate travel recommendations. The user interface is designed to be simple and provides comprehensive weather details for travel planning and daily activities.

## Minimum UI Requirements
The interface of this app clearly and concisely displays all key data. The search box at the top can search for the target city, and the middle is the area of ​​travel suggestions. The overall color is bright and easy to use.

## Testing and Evaluation
During the testing phase, I tested different cities around the world, including various weather conditions (such as high temperature, low temperature, sunny, rainy days, etc.), and the results were all correctly fed back.

## Conclusion
This program can correctly achieve the target function and is very reliable and stable.
