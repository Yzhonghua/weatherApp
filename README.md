## How It Works
Upon launching, the app displays weather information for a default city (Seattle, US). Users can enter any other city into the input field and press the "Fetch Weather" button to retrieve and display the latest weather information for their chosen location.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **API Used:** OpenWeatherMap API
- **Platform:** Android

## Development
This application was developed over approximately 40 hours spread across several weeks. The main development tasks included setting up the Android project, designing the user interface, and implementing the API integration.

## Challenges Faced
Several challenges were encountered during the development of WeatherApp:
- **API Integration:** Handling asynchronous API calls and ensuring that the app remains responsive during data fetching.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling to manage instances when the weather data could not be retrieved.
- **User Interface:** Designing a user-friendly interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to OpenWeatherMap for providing free access to their weather APIs.
- Appreciation to all online communities and forums that offered invaluable help and resources that greatly assisted in troubleshooting during the development process.
